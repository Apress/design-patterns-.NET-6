# Summary

Key takeaways from the examples we've seen:

* You can build pretty DSLs by leveraging list construction
* It's easy for functions to take other functions as parameters
* You can create in-place instances of types with abstract members
* Discriminated unions
  * Pre-compile constructors
  * Parse text into nested union cases
  * Recursive traversal looks neat
