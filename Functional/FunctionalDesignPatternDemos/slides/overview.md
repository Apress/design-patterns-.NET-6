# The Functional Perspective
Why does this section even exist?

---

# Overview

* The functional paradigm is supported by both C# and F#.
* Both languages claim to be *multi-paradigm*
  * Fully support both OOP and functional
* F# is a more functional-first language
* Functional-specific (non-OOP, non-GoF) patterns
    * These are called *monads*
* Classic GoF patterns exist mainly in the OOP paradigm
  * Can be implemented in F#
  * This is what we'll cover in this bonus section!

# Functional Language Features

This section of the course assumes that you know F#. We make use of the following language features:

* Functional literals
* Functional composition
* Tail recursion
  
Functional-related features:

* Discriminated unions
* Functional lists
* Pattern matching (esp. on discriminated unions, lists, etc.)

# Patterns

We shall investigate the following:

* Builder (DSL-like construction)
* Decorator (functional)
* Factory (in-place construction of interface types)
* Interpeter (parsing structure into discriminated union members)
* Strategy (higher-order functions)
* Template Method (also HOFs)
